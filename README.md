Description-In this project, we developed an Event Registration webApp - IonsEve. Basically this web app has separate features for admin to create and manage the events and users to participate in the events. Technically,we have taken care of Authentication and Database flow. Through this web app users can go online for smooth and hassle-free registration for the upcoming events. Users can book tickets beforehand.The users can also build their profile so their information will be auto-populated while filling registration forms. All the information regarding the events like event ID of the users will be conveyed to the users through email. The Admin can manage all the information regarding the events and the users participating in different events. In this project we have taken care of fulfilling all the requirements for the web app and also provided add-ons like dynamic graph to show number of users in different registration types.
